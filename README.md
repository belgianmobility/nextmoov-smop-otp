# SMOP - OTP

This repository gives a set of scripts to ease the bootstrapping of an OTP instance.

We invite you to review the OTP documentation for more infos about OTP.

- [General information about OTP](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/)
- [OTP api documentation](http://dev.opentripplanner.org/apidoc/)

## Requirements
  - At least 16Go of RAM
  - docker
  - docker-compose


## Running the service
- clone the repo    
   `git clone git@github.com:nextmoov/nextmoov-smop-otp.git`
- move into the created folder  
   `cd nextmoov-smop-otp`
- provide source data (see [Modules](https://github.com/nextmoov/nextmoov-smop-otp#modules))
- build the database (see [with otp](https://github.com/nextmoov/nextmoov-smop-general/#with-otp) - takes 15 to 20 min)  
   `docker-compose run otp-builder ./build`
- run via docker-compose  
   `docker-compose up`



## Architecture

## Modules

You need to provide both **osm.pbf** file and the **static GTFS zip files** in the `data` directory  alongside the docker-compose.yml file.  
The provided static GTFS files needs to be named xxx-gtfs.zip (where xxx is only composed of lower case letters - what you put in place of xxx doesn't matter as long as it follow the template. The otp-builder will look through the folder for file named according to said template â€“ see [General > data-sources](https://github.com/nextmoov/nextmoov-smop-general/blob/master/README.md#data-sources) for more information).


### Builder

It will start OTP in build mode with the files in `./data` as input. (See [General > launching-the-modules](https://github.com/nextmoov/nextmoov-smop-general/blob/master/README.md#launching-the-modules) for more information).

### OTP

When you run `docker-compose up`, it will start OTP with the built Graph (see Builder). It takes some times to start.

When the system is started you can acces your brand new OTP instance on http://localhost:8081/

And the API is accessible from http://localhost:8080/otp

A `router-config.json` example file is provided to get GTFS RT update and JC Decaux / Villo. See [General > data-sources](https://github.com/nextmoov/nextmoov-smop-general#data-sources) about the GTFS RT feeds.
